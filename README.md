# Codecademy-C-Projects
This is in preparation for the OSEP. The OSEP heavily relies on C# for writing custom shellcode runners and different bypasses. 

The first project is: Console_Creatures.cs. The project revolved aronud creating ASCII art, which is useful in learning how to create cool bannners for programs. Banners are obviously the most important part of a program. 

The second program that is not actually part of a project is useful. It teaches you that Console.ReadLine will always return a string. Therefore, it is important that once the string is returned and a function is expecting an interger, you gotta covert it using Convert.ToInt32.
